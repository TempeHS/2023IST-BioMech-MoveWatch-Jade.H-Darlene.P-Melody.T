/* 
> sorry  dardar we deleted your code because i got the accelerometer working
+ we also got the stepcounter working

notes for you:
? can you do the health bar since i did the accelerometer
- download step counter library: arduino_bma456.h, link found on its sensor catalogue, download from github

- download visual studio code (b jones recommendation) for easier navigation when INTEGRATING/MERGING CODE ONLY 
- create folder to make functions to include in mainline to integrate all our code
- then call those functions in the main folder
